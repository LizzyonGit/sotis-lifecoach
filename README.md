# Sotis lifecoach

Sotis is a lifecoach, and this is his website. The website targets people interested in getting a lifecoach. The website shows who Sotis is, how he works and what he offers. Visitors can read what sessions entail and how much they cost, the images give more context and they can read about what previous clients think of their sessions with Sotis. The contact information and social media links give the visitor the possibility to ask questions or look for more information about Sotis beyond his website. The visitor has the possibility to book an appointment via a form on the website.

#### As a person interested in seeing a lifecoach, I want to:
-  find information about Sotis the lifecoach and how he works, so that I can decide if I consider booking an appointment with him.
#### As a potential client, I want to:
- find information about what Sotis can offer me, how much it would cost and where it would be, so that I can decide if I want to book an appointment with him.
- be able to contact Sotis, so that I can ask questions about anything unclear, so that I can decide if I still want to book an appoitnment with him.

#### Tasks to achieve user stories (or in testing section?)

- create a testimonials section that contains a few reviews from other clients,
- create a navbar with navigation to Home, About, Philosophy, Testimonials, What I offer and Book,
- create a footer with contact information, address, social media links,
- create a header on the Home page with a quote over a Hero image.

### Design
#### Wireframes

#### Color schemes
I searched on internet for lifecoach websites and my mentor also instantly said I would probably use a lot of blue because it conveys calmness. So I found this website that I really liked: https://themewagon.github.io/Pilates/, I picked two colors from it (#55CBD2 and #C5FFF1), and went to https://coolors.co/55cbd2-c5fff1-173753-1b4353 where I entered those two colors and asked for two more colors. Keeping in mind the mainly blue theme, I went with these two complementary darker colors: #173753, #1B4353.
My main background is white, as I don't want to overdo it with a blue background. Also on the hero image, I used a neutral transparent black background with white text to not intervene with the image. 
For color contrast, the text color-background combinations used score from 6.36 and up.

#### Fonts
I went on Google fonts and set the filter to "Calm", browsing throught the results this one stuck out to me: Montserrat Alternates. I liked the "E" being different than the other fonts. For a pairing, I couldn't find anything on some of the font pairing sites, but when I just googled font pair with "Montserrat Alternates", this blog came up (https://approval.studio/blog/how-to-combine-fonts/), where they argued for the pair Montserrat Alternates and Raleway, so I decided to go with that.

#### Logos and images
All used images are my own. I have not created any logos.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing features

- __Navigation bar__

  - All three pages have a navigation bar with "Sotis lifecoach" and "Home" linking to the index.html page, "About", "Philosophy" and "Testimonials" linking to the corresponding sections on the index.html page, "What I offer" linking to the what-i-offer.html page and the "Book" button linking to the book.html page. The page you are currently on is lighting up for the "Home" and "What I offer" pages.
  - The navigation bar allows the user to easily navigate from page to page and to specific sections on a page.

- __The landing page image__

  - The langing page has a hero image of Sotis, looking into the camera, with an appropriate quote about cats and life. This section hopes to grasp the user's attention and give a positive feeling.

![Landing page image](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_landing.png)

- __About section__

  - The About section gives an introduction to who Sotis is. For a user wanting to know more about Sotis, this is important information. The insight to who he is helps making a decision on whether or not to book an appointment.

![About](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

- __Image with caption__
- The image with caption between the About and Philosophy section, where Sotis sits with a notebook, should give the user more context. For the user it is part of gaining more information about Sotis and seeing him at work.

- __Philosophy section__

  - The Philosophy section gives an insight in how Sotis works and what his methods and convictions are. This gives the user more information about his professionality and helps in making the decision to book an appointment or not.

![Philosophy](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_times.png)

- __Testimonials section__

- The Testimonials section displays previous clients' testimonials about their experiences with Sotis. They are displayed in a text-based carousel, with control buttons and playing on page load. This section is important in convincing users to book an appointment, as the testimonials come from people outside and will gain trust for Sotis.

![Testimonials](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_times.png)

- __The footer__ 

  - The footer section includes an address, email address, phone number and links to X, Facebook and Instagram. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The address and contact information are important for the user to know where Sotis works, and the possibility to contact him is important to gain trust. The links to the social media are important so the user can get more information and context outside the website, potentially also seeing how trustworthy Sotis is by checking followers and comments on social media.

- __The What I offer page__

  - The page What I offer has an introductary header text with a button which links to the book.html page, and displays the four different sessions you can book with Sotis in card format. Each card has a title, description, related image and a footer with duration and fee information. This page is crucial for the user to decide if they want to book a session and if so, which session they want to book.

- A custom logo, and matching favicon,
- A sticky navbar specifically for mobile screens,
- A testimonials section with small profile pictures, and possibly several testimonials at once for large screens.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
