# Sotis lifecoach

Sotis is a lifecoach, and this is his website. The website targets people interested in getting a lifecoach. The website shows who Sotis is, how he works and what he offers. Visitors can read what sessions entail and how much they cost, the images give more context and they can read about what previous clients think of their sessions with Sotis. The contact information and social media links give the visitor the possibility to ask questions or look for more information about Sotis beyond his website. The visitor has the possibility to book an appointment via a form on the website.

## Planning
### Site goals
- Inform visitors about Sotis the lifecoach, who he is, how he works and what he offers. 
- Give visitors practical information such as address and contact information, prices and session lengths. 
- Convince visitors to book an appointment with Sotis the lifecoach and provide a way to book this appointment. 
- The website aims to be responsive across all screen sizes, with user friendly navigation and present information in a clear consistent way without overinforming. 

### User stories
#### As a person interested in seeing a lifecoach, I want to:
-  find information about Sotis the lifecoach and how he works, so that I can decide if I consider booking an appointment with him.
#### As a potential client, I want to:
- find information about what Sotis can offer me, how much it would cost and where it would be, so that I can decide if I want to book an appointment with him.
- be able to contact Sotis, so that I can ask questions about anything unclear, so that I can decide if I still want to book an appoitnment with him.
- read reviews from previous clients, to decide if I also want to book an appointment with Sotis.
- find a way to book an appointment, so that I can do this in an easy way on the website.
#### As a confirmed client, I want to:
- find contact information, so that I can contact Sotis about any matter regarding my appointment.
#### As a site owner, I want to:
- get word around about a special cat offering life coach services, so that I build brand awareness.
- convince visitors to book an appointment, so that I grow my business and help clients.

#### Tasks to achieve user stories (or in testing section?)
- create informative sections with background information about Sotis and according to which philosophy he works, with an image,
- create informative cards about the different sessions Sotis can offer the client and what these cost,  how long they take and what they entail, with a suiting image,
- create a form where a client can choose a session and a date and time to book this session, along with filling in name, email, phone and a message,
- create a testimonials section that contains a few reviews from other clients,
- create a navbar with navigation to Home, About, Philosophy, Testimonials, What I offer and Book,
- create a footer with contact information, address, social media links,
- create a header on the Home page with a quote over a Hero image.

### Design
#### Wireframes

#### Color schemes
I searched on internet for lifecoach websites and my mentor also instantly said I would probably use a lot of blue because it conveys calmness. So I found this website that I really liked: https://themewagon.github.io/Pilates/, I picked two colors from it (#55CBD2 and #C5FFF1), and went to https://coolors.co/55cbd2-c5fff1-173753-1b4353 where I entered those two colors and asked for two more colors. Keeping in mind the mainly blue theme, I went with these two complementary darker colors: #173753, #1B4353.

#### Fonts
I went on Google fonts and set the filter to "Calm", browsing throught the results this one stuck out to me: Montserrat Alternates. I liked the "E" being different than the other fonts. For a pairing, I couldn't find anything on some of the font pairing sites, but when I just googled font pair with "Montserrat Alternates", this blog came up (https://approval.studio/blog/how-to-combine-fonts/#:~:text=Montserrat%20Alternates%20%2B%20Raleway,-In%20this%20case&text=Raleway%20complements%20it%3B%20being%20quite,allows%20one%20to%20enjoy%20it.) and I decided to go with the suggested font Raleway.

#### Logos and images
All used images are my own. I have not created any logos.

- A possibility to sign up to a newsletter, where Sotis gives lifecoach tips for example,

- A custom logo,
- A sticky navbar specifically for mobile screens.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Fixed bugs

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Technologies used
### Languages
### Frameworks - libraries - programs used

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so itâ€™s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used â€˜image1.pngâ€™ consider naming it â€˜landing_page_img.pngâ€™. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
